## Galaxy Zoo And D3

Using D3 to Visualise Galaxy Zoo data

### Getting Started

The _script_ folder contains scripts to geenrate data from the Galaxy Zoo DB.
The _public_ folder contains the website itself and is split into _index.html_, which is the main file and subsidiary _js_, _css_ and _data_ folders which should be easy to understand.

Simply open the file index.html as a webpage to view this locally. You might need to host the public folder on a server (e.g. Dropbox or S3) to get everything to display properly.

### D3

Loads of examples and background information can be found on the main d3.js site at http://d3js.org

### Sankey Diagrams

Currently this repo shows just Sankey diagrams. Data have bene generated for a selection of interesting Galaxy Zoo objects. These data are found in the data directory.
